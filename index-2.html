                David Nanninga is the owner of Mile High Coatings. Here we can
                say something about Dave and his family and his career - I need
                something to fill this up. <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                David started Mile High Coatings in 2008. After years of working
                hard, David and his crew were able to overcome the Great
                Recession, growing the customer base by providing excellent
                customer service, fair prices and quality jobs. After 15 years,
                Mile High Coatings has become The Recommended Painting &
                Flooring Company in Northern Colorado.

            <h1 class="mh-section-history-title">How We Started</h1>
            <p class="mh-section-history-description">
              After graduating in 2006 from Colorado State University in Fort
              Collins, David started Mile High Coatings in 2008. He began, quite
              literally, from the ground up, by knocking on doors, during what
              was the beginning of the Great Recession.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />

              Through dedication and persistence, while many similar companies
              were failing and closing, David grew his customer base by
              providing excellent customer service, fair prices and quality
              paint jobs. Knowing that there was more to the industry, he
              started researching epoxy applications.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />

              After attending and participating in training seminars, talking to
              product sales reps and learning from others with experience, Mile
              High Coatings started installing epoxy coatings on residential
              garage floors. At this point, one thing led to another and the
              reputation for high-quality, expert concrete coatings applications
              grew. The growth in this niche led to other opportunities,
              including staining concrete, commercial floors and starting in
              2015, garage storage solutions. David still runs the day-to-day
              operations.
